## Abstract:
The search for dark matter weakly interacting massive particles with noble liquids has probed masses down and below a GeV/c^2.  The ultimate limit is represented by the experimental  threshold  on  the  energy  transfer  to  the  nuclear  recoil.   Currently,  the experimental sensitivity has reached a threshold equivalent to a few ionization electrons.  In these conditions, the contribution of a Bremsstrahlung photon or a so-called Migdal electron due to the sudden acceleration of a nucleus after a collision might be sizable. In the present work, we use a Bayesian approach to study how these effects an be exploited in experiments based on liquid argon detectors.  In particular, taking inspiration from the DarkSide-50 public spectra, we develop a simulated experiment to show how the Migdal electron and the Bremsstrahlung photon allow to push the experimental sensitivity down to masses of 0.1 GeV/c2, extending the search region for dark matter particles of previous results. For these masses we estimate the effect of the Earth shielding that, for strongly interacting dark matter, makes any detectorblind.  Finally, we show how the sensitivity scales for higher exposure.
